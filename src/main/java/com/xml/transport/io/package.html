  Welcome, the purpose of this package is to provide an XML Transport Layer for you to send and recieve 
  data between 2 network nodes (wether they be peers, client/server, etc).  The idea is that you use XML
  documents as the method for sending/recieving data.  
  
  If you're familiar with the XML APIs in Java, they close the I/O Stream when reading an XML Document.  
  To properly do this, InputStream had to be extended in such a manner that a pre-processor analyzes the
  incoming bytes to look for an XML Document, and simulate closing to appease the XML APIs, and maintain
  the open InputStream.
